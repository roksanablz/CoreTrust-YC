# Scraping Script Improvements

## 1. API Rate Limiting
- **Issue**: Many requests failed with "429 You exceeded your current quota" errors
- **Impact**: Script fails to process many URLs due to OpenAI API rate limits
- **Solution**: 
  - Implement rate limiting logic
  - Add retry mechanism with exponential backoff
  - Consider implementing a queue system for requests

## 2. HTTP 403 Forbidden Errors
- **Issue**: Requests to congress.gov and other government sites failing with 403 errors
- **Impact**: Unable to access important policy documents
- **Solution**:
  - Add proper headers to requests
  - Implement user-agent rotation
  - Consider adding authentication where required

## 3. PDF Processing
- **Issue**: "Warning: TT: undefined function: 32" errors when processing PDFs
- **Impact**: Incomplete or failed PDF text extraction
- **Solution**:
  - Review and improve PDF handling logic
  - Consider alternative PDF parsing libraries
  - Add better error handling for PDF-specific issues

## 4. Network Stability
- **Issue**: "read ECONNRESET" errors during requests
- **Impact**: Interrupted data collection
- **Solution**:
  - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Add connection timeout handling
  - Consider implementing a circuit breaker pattern

## 5. Error Handling
- **Issue**: Basic error logging without detailed information
- **Impact**: Difficult to debug and track failures
- **Solution**:
  - Implement comprehensive error logging
  - Add error categorization
  - Create a mechanism to resume from failures
  - Add detailed error reporting

## 6. Performance Optimization
- **Issue**: Sequential processing of URLs
- **Impact**: Slow execution time
- **Solution**:
  - Implement parallel processing
  - Add proper rate limiting for concurrent requests
  - Consider using a worker pool pattern

## Implementation Priority
1. API Rate Limiting (Most critical for script functionality)
2. Error Handling (Important for debugging and reliability)
3. HTTP 403 Handling (Critical for data collection)
4. Network Stability (Important for reliability)
5. PDF Processing (Important for data quality)
6. Performance Optimization (Nice to have for efficiency)

## Notes
- Consider implementing these improvements incrementally
- Test each improvement thoroughly before moving to the next
- Monitor API usage and costs when implementing rate limiting
- Keep track of successful vs failed requests for each improvement
